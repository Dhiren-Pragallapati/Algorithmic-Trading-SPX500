# Implemented Strategies
# Warren Buffett's Value Investing Strategy
This strategy focuses on identifying undervalued companies with strong fundamentals. The filtering criteria include:
P/E ratio below sector average
ROE above sector average
Debt/Equity ratio below sector average
Profit margin above sector average
# Other Strategies
The repository also includes implementations of Peter Lynch's, Philip Fisher's, and Benjamin Graham's strategies, each with its own set of criteria for stock selection.
# Data
